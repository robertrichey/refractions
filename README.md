# Refractions: An Electroacoustic Prologue
Commissioned for the Wilmington Classical Guitar Society is a duo for classical guitar and
electronics, this piece was composed in late 2022&ndash;early 2023 and premiered on April 29th of 
that year by Robert Richy and Matthew Kaplan in Wilmington, Delaware.

It is semi-improvisational, consisting of a basic form, pitch material for the guitarist, and ChucK 
scripts for a laptop performer. The _Refractions_ portion of its title, decided after a dialogue 
with ChatGPT, refers to the way the guitarist's output is used as input and processed in real-time 
to create the electronic portion of the piece. The scripts utilize various combination sof delay, 
reverb, live sampling, pitch shifting, distortion, and panning to complement the improvisations of 
the guitarist. The _Prologue_ portion serves two purposes: It suits the occastion of its premier, 
being performed as the opener of a classical guitar recital by 2022 GFA Winner Bokyung Byun, as well
as being the first piece publicly performed by Robert and Matthew as the ZKDuo.
